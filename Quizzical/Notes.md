# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


//SELF NOTES <----------------------->

-------------FUNCTIONALITY-------------

- - Randomize the answers so they're in different spots. Currently, i just have them indexed to the index that the api gave me, but currently that makes it so that the correct answer is in the same position for every question.
/////DONE

- - have the answer buttons take up the whole of their space so i can click anywhere inside of them to select.
/////DONE

- - convert the strange syntax that appears in some of the questions
/////DONE

- - Need to find a way to get rid of the error im getting when there are too many requests in a short period of time.

- - have the background color of the clicked button change  

- - When the check answers button is pressed, change to the check answers screen, which shows which answers you got wrong/right, and highlighs them depending on that, while also displaying your score at the bottom.


-------------------STYLING----------
- - Make the yellow and blue blobs on the corners of the page bigger if in the starting screen, and smaller if in the quiz screens.

- - Needs to be made responsive for different viewport and screen sizes.
